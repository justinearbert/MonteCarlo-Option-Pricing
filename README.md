# Monte Carlo Option Pricing

## Project Overview
Python script to price a European call using a Monte Carlo simulation.  
Simulates final asset prices and calculates the expected payoff.

## Objective
To understand option pricing through Monte Carlo simulations and visualize the distribution of possible outcomes.

## Materials Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib

## Key Features

- Calculates European call option payoff and discounted price  
- Plots histogram of final asset prices with strike price
